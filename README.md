# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-System-Using-Deep-learning
Traffic Sign Recognition System Using Deep Learning Code Summary:

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
   Acquired a diverse dataset of traffic sign images and preprocessed them for model training, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

2. **Model Architecture:**
   Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, possibly leveraging popular frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, for feature extraction and classification.

3. **Training and Optimization:**
   Trained the CNN model using the annotated dataset, employing techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and learning rate scheduling for optimization.

4. **Evaluation and Validation:**
   Evaluated the trained model's performance on a separate validation dataset, assessing metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure robustness and generalization.

5. **Deployment and Integration:**
   Deployed the trained model into a production environment, possibly utilizing frameworks like Flask or Django for building RESTful APIs, to enable real-time traffic sign recognition in applications or systems. Additionally, integrated with traffic surveillance systems or autonomous vehicles for real-world usage scenarios.
